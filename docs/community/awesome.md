- is go-micro true gRPC?

  > go-micro use [QUIC](https://github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go) as default transport, which is foundation for [HTTP/3](https://nordicapis.com/what-is-coming-in-http-3-quic/)<br/>
  > We can make gRPC as transport for go-micro services via command line flags.<br/>
  > Please read [micro-grpc](https://github.com/micro/development/blob/master/grpc.md) for more info.
